I am Xijun (Ted) Li.  Currently I am a researcher at [Noah's Ark Lab](http://www.noahlab.com.hk) of Huawei. Prior to Noah's Ark Lab, I received my master degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University under supervision of [Prof. Jianguo Yao](http://tcloud.sjtu.edu.cn/users/jianguo/) and [Dr. Mingxuan Yuan](https://sites.google.com/site/mingxuanhw/). My main research interests are on optimization, meta-heuristic algorithm, and AutoML. More detailed information about my career are available on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xijun-li-a7a8a1111/). If you have any question about my post, please feel free to contact me through xijun.lee@hotmail.com
